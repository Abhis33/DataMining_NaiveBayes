On the complete training set we've used k-fold cross validation -
The following strategies were used -
-> Accuracy
-> Confusion matrix
-> Precision and recall
-> F1 Measure

The results were (Average of k-fold cross validation where k = 10) -
-> Accuracy - 82.125
-> Precision and recall - 0.772 & 0.595
-> F1 Measure - 0.336

The accuracy can be increased by -
-> Increasing the training Dataset so each of the sub-classes can have enough number of samples. 
-> Balancing instances of both '<=50K' and '>50K'.
